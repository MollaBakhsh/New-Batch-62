## Checking Even or Odd Numbers
Once the numbers are collected, the program checks if each number is even or odd. A new list, even_odd_list, stores each number along with whether it is even or odd. The program then prints these findings to the user.

### Calculating Squares of the Numbers
The program then calculates the square of each of the user's favorite numbers. It stores the number along with its square in the squares list and prints this to the user as well.

#### Summing Numbers and Prime Check
The final step involves calculating the sum of the user's favorite numbers and checking if this sum is a prime number. The result is then printed, indicating whether the sum is prime or not.
